# Microstructural-Materials-Science

## This is a collection of juypter notebooks with a hope to elaborate concepts of materials science by connecting physical phenomenon with microstructure evolution. The goal is to provide real-life microscopy examples of the often-abstract materials science concepts. Also taking advantages of the interactive features of the Juypter notebooks and scientific Python packages, this collection is designed to help materials science undergraduates, graduates and researchers who are not familar with the microstructure world but are keen to grasp the ideas.
